## Homework1

### *- Need to have (for passing grade):*
- [x] Data classes are created for Article and Source
- [x] 5 TextViews where each one includes text of the article title, author, and source name.
- [x] Nullable types are used for certain properties which can be null such as author, source id. Other properties can be checked from News API documentation.
- [x] Hardcoded news data is saved in ArrayList
- [x] Layout for main activity is created
- [ ] Loops are used for iterating the list and data is shown on the screen
- [ ] Null checks are done using if/else statements
- [ ] Code is divided into multiple functions instead of doing everything in onCreate(). At least one new function should be created.

### *- Nice to have (for Above and Beyond):*
- [ ] Use default values with functions
- [ ] Use maps to store hardcoded data instead of ArrayList
